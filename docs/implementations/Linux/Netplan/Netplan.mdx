            # Basics

            Netplan is a powerful and easy-to-use network configuration utility for Linux, most notably on Ubuntu 17.10 and newer. It uses a human-readable YAML format to describe network interfaces, making configuration straightforward and consistent.

            ---

            ### How Netplan Works

            1.  **YAML files**: You define your network configuration in `.yaml` files stored in the `/etc/netplan/` directory.
            2.  **Renderers**: Netplan reads these files and generates the necessary configuration for one of its backend renderers, either `systemd-networkd` (for servers) or `NetworkManager` (for desktops).
            3.  **Apply configuration**: The `sudo netplan apply` command then takes the rendered configuration and applies it to your system.

            ### File Structure

            Netplan configuration files follow a simple, hierarchical structure.

            ```yaml
            network:
            version: 2
            renderer: networkd # or NetworkManager
            ethernets:
                enp3s0:
                ...
            bridges:
                br0:
                ...
            wifis:
                wlan0:
                ...
            ```

            # Interface Bonding

            Network **bonding** (also known as **link aggregation**) combines multiple network interfaces into a single logical interface to increase throughput, improve redundancy, or both.  
            If one interface fails, traffic automatically switches to the others, ensuring network continuity.

            With **Netplan**, setting up a bonded interface involves three main steps:

            1. **Disable** individual configuration (like DHCP) on the physical interfaces you plan to bond.  
            2. **Define** a bond interface that lists these physical interfaces as its members.  
            3. **Configure** the IP settings (DHCP or static) on the **bond interface**, not the physical ones.

            ---

            ## Example 1: Bond with DHCP

            This example creates a bond named `bond0` using **mode balance-rr** (round-robin), and assigns its IP address via **DHCP**.  
            It disables DHCP on the physical interfaces `enp3s0` and `enp4s0`.

            **File:** `/etc/netplan/50-bonding.yaml`

            ```yaml
            network:
            version: 2
            renderer: networkd
            ethernets:
                enp3s0:
                dhcp4: false
                dhcp6: false
                enp4s0:
                dhcp4: false
                dhcp6: false

            bonds:
                bond0:
                interfaces: [enp3s0, enp4s0]
                parameters:
                    mode: balance-rr
                    mii-monitor-interval: 100
                dhcp4: true
            ```

            ### Steps to apply

            1. Save the configuration file above to `/etc/netplan/50-bonding.yaml`.  
            2. Apply the configuration:  
            ```bash
            sudo netplan apply
            ```
            3. Verify the bond interface:  
            ```bash
            ip a
            ```
            You should see `bond0` with an IP address obtained via DHCP.  

            ---

            ## Example 2: Bond with Static IP

            This example assigns a **static IP address** to the bonded interface instead of using DHCP.

            **File:** `/etc/netplan/50-bonding.yaml`

            ```yaml
            network:
            version: 2
            renderer: networkd
            ethernets:
                enp3s0:
                dhcp4: false
                dhcp6: false
                enp4s0:
                dhcp4: false
                dhcp6: false

            bonds:
                bond0:
                interfaces: [enp3s0, enp4s0]
                parameters:
                    mode: active-backup
                    primary: enp3s0
                    mii-monitor-interval: 100
                dhcp4: false
                addresses:
                    - 192.168.1.50/24
                routes:
                    - to: default
                    via: 192.168.1.1
                nameservers:
                    addresses:
                    - 8.8.8.8
                    - 8.8.4.4
            ```

            ### Explanation

            - `mode: active-backup` — Only one interface is active at a time. If the primary (`enp3s0`) fails, another interface takes over automatically.  
            - `mii-monitor-interval: 100` — Checks link status every 100 ms.  
            - `addresses`, `routes`, and `nameservers` — Configure static IP settings for the bonded interface.

            ---

            ### Testing and Verification

            Before applying permanently, test your configuration:
            ```bash
            sudo netplan try
            ```

            Apply it permanently:
            ```bash
            sudo netplan apply
            ```

            Check the bond status:
            ```bash
            cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0
            ```

            Check the network interfaces:
            ```bash
            ip a
            ```

            ---

            ### Common Bonding Modes

            | Mode | Description |
            |------|--------------|
            | **balance-rr (0)** | Round-robin load balancing across all interfaces. |
            | **active-backup (1)** | One interface active; others standby. High availability. |
            | **balance-xor (2)** | Transmit based on hash (MAC/IP). |
            | **broadcast (3)** | Sends traffic on all interfaces simultaneously. |
            | **802.3ad (4)** | IEEE 802.3ad dynamic link aggregation (requires switch support). |
            | **balance-tlb (5)** | Adaptive transmit load balancing. |
            | **balance-alb (6)** | Adaptive load balancing (transmit + receive). |

            ---

            With Netplan, interface bonding provides both **performance** and **resilience**.  
            Always verify your configuration with `netplan status` and monitor bond health via `/proc/net/bonding/bond0`.

            # Bridging Interfaces

            Network bridging is a way to create a virtual switch that connects multiple network interfaces (physical or virtual) on the same host. This is a common requirement for virtualization and container technologies to allow guest systems to connect to the external network. 

            With Netplan, creating a bridge involves three key steps:

            1. Disable the network configuration on the physical interface(s) you want to include in the bridge.
            2. Define the bridge interface, specifying the physical interfaces as its members.
            3. Configure the IP address, DHCP, and other network settings on the new bridge interface, not on the physical interfaces. 

            ---

            ## Example 1: Bridge with DHCP

            This example creates a bridge named `br0` and uses DHCP to automatically assign an IP address. It disables DHCP on the physical interface `enp3s0`, making it a member of the bridge.  

            **File:** `/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml`

            ```yaml
            network:
            version: 2
            renderer: networkd
            ethernets:
                enp3s0:
                dhcp4: false
                dhcp6: false
            bridges:
                br0:
                interfaces: [enp3s0]
                dhcp4: true
            ```

            ### Steps to apply

            1. Create the file with the configuration above, or edit your existing Netplan file.  
            2. Apply the configuration:  
            ```bash
            sudo netplan apply
            ```
            3. Verify the bridge:  
            ```bash
            ip a
            ```
            Confirm that the new `br0` interface has an IP address.  

            ---

            ## Example 2: Bridge with Static IP

            For a fixed IP address, you disable DHCP on both the physical interface and the bridge itself. The IP, gateway, and DNS are then configured on the bridge.  

            **File:** `/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml`

            ```yaml
            network:
            version: 2
            renderer: networkd
            ethernets:
                enp3s0:
                dhcp4: false
            bridges:
                br0:
                interfaces: [enp3s0]
                dhcp4: false
                addresses:
                    - 192.168.1.100/24
                routes:
                    - to: default
                    via: 192.168.1.1
                nameservers:
                    addresses:
                    - 8.8.8.8
                    - 8.8.4.4
            ```

            This static IP example configures IP addresses, routes, and nameservers directly under the `br0` bridge definition.  

            To bridge multiple physical interfaces, list them under the `interfaces` key for the bridge, disabling DHCP on each.  

            Before applying, test with:  
            ```bash
            sudo netplan try
            ```

            Then apply permanently:  
            ```bash
            sudo netplan apply
            ```

            Verify the configuration:  
            ```bash
            netplan status
            ip a
            ```
