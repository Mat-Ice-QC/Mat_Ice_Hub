# ZFS: Basics 


## What is ZFS?
**ZFS (Zettabyte File System)** is a combined file system and logical volume manager originally developed by Sun Microsystems. It’s designed to provide high storage capacity, reliability, and ease of management.

---

## Key Features

### 1. **Pooled Storage**
Unlike traditional file systems that manage disks individually, ZFS uses a **storage pool (zpool)**.  
This allows multiple drives to be grouped together, with the file system dynamically allocating space across them as needed.

### 2. **Data Integrity**
ZFS uses **checksums** to verify data integrity.  
Whenever data is read, ZFS checks its checksum to ensure it hasn’t been corrupted — if it detects an error and redundancy is available, it automatically repairs the data.

### 3. **Snapshots and Clones**
- **Snapshots**: Read-only points-in-time of the file system that can be used for backups or restores.
- **Clones**: Writable copies of snapshots, useful for testing or versioning data.

### 4. **Compression and Deduplication**
ZFS supports **on-the-fly compression** and **deduplication** to save disk space and optimize performance.

### 5. **RAID-Z**
ZFS introduces **RAID-Z**, an improved form of RAID that protects against data loss due to disk failure and eliminates the “write hole” problem present in traditional RAID.

---

## Basic Structure

- **Pool (zpool)** → Group of disks managed together.
- **Dataset** → A file system or volume within the pool.
- **Snapshot/Clone** → Data versions or copies of datasets.

---

## Basic ZFS Commands

1. **Create a ZFS pool:**

```bash
sudo zpool create mypool /dev/sdb
```

2. **Check pool status:**

```bash
sudo zpool status
```

3. **Create a ZFS filesystem:**

```bash
sudo zfs create mypool/mydata
```

4. **List ZFS filesystems:**

```bash
zfs list
```

5. **Destroy a ZFS pool (Warning: Data loss!):**

```bash
sudo zpool destroy mypool
```

# ZFS: Install

ZFS is a robust file system and volume manager designed for high storage capacities, data integrity, and easy management. This guide explains how to install and set up ZFS on common Linux distributions.

---


## Prerequisites

Before installing ZFS, ensure you have:

* Root or sudo privileges.
* A Linux system (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, etc.).
* At least one storage device to use for ZFS pools.

---

## Ubuntu / Debian

1. **Update your package list:**

```bash
sudo apt update
```

2. **Install ZFS utilities:**

```bash
sudo apt install zfsutils-linux zfs-dkms -y
```

3. **Load the ZFS kernel module:**

```bash
sudo modprobe zfs
```

---

## CentOS / RHEL / Fedora

1. **Enable EPEL and ZFS repositories:**

```bash
sudo dnf install -y epel-release
sudo dnf install -y https://zfsonlinux.org/epel/zfs-release.el8_8.noarch.rpm
```

2. **Import the ZFS repository key:**

```bash
sudo rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-zfsonlinux
```

3. **Install ZFS packages:**

```bash
sudo dnf install -y zfs
```

4. **Load the ZFS kernel module:**

```bash
sudo modprobe zfs
```

---

## Verifying Installation

Check if ZFS is installed correctly:

```bash
zfs version
```

You should see output similar to:

```
zfs-2.1.9-1
zfs-kmod-2.1.9-1
```

# ZFS: RAIDZ2 and RAIDZ3 

## What is RAIDZ?
**RAIDZ** is ZFS’s version of RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks), designed to offer data redundancy and protection against disk failures.

Unlike traditional RAID, **RAIDZ** avoids the "write hole" problem by ensuring all data and parity are written atomically, maintaining consistent and reliable storage.

---

## RAIDZ Levels Overview

| RAIDZ Level | Fault Tolerance | Parity Disks | Usable Space Formula | Recommended Minimum Disks |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| RAIDZ1 | 1 disk failure | 1 | (N - 1) × Disk Size | 3 |
| **RAIDZ2** | **2 disk failures** | **2** | **(N - 2) × Disk Size** | **4** |
| **RAIDZ3** | **3 disk failures** | **3** | **(N - 3) × Disk Size** | **5** |

---

## RAIDZ2: Double Parity Protection

### Description
RAIDZ2 stores **two parity blocks** for every stripe of data.  
This means it can survive **two simultaneous disk failures** without losing data.

### Example
If you have 6 drives of 4TB each:

```
Usable Capacity = (6 - 2) × 4TB = 16TB usable
```

### Pros
- Protects against two drive failures  
- Good balance between performance and redundancy  
- Excellent for medium to large storage systems  

### Cons
- Slightly reduced write performance compared to RAIDZ1  
- More storage overhead due to extra parity blocks  

### Example Command
```bash
zpool create tank raidz2 /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd /dev/sde /dev/sdf
```

---

## RAIDZ3: Triple Parity Protection

### Description
RAIDZ3 provides **three parity blocks** per stripe.  
It can tolerate **up to three disk failures** — ideal for large or critical storage pools.

### Example
If you have 8 drives of 4TB each:

```
Usable Capacity = (8 - 3) × 4TB = 20TB usable
```

### Pros
- Can survive three simultaneous disk failures  
- Highest level of redundancy in ZFS RAIDZ  
- Excellent for mission-critical or large-capacity pools  

### Cons
- Lower usable capacity due to triple parity  
- Slightly slower writes compared to RAIDZ2  

### Example Command
```bash
zpool create backup raidz3 /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd /dev/sde /dev/sdf /dev/sdg /dev/sdh
```

---

## Choosing Between RAIDZ2 and RAIDZ3

| Use Case | Recommended RAIDZ Level |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Home NAS or small server | RAIDZ1 or RAIDZ2 |
| Medium business storage | RAIDZ2 |
| Enterprise or mission-critical data | RAIDZ3 |
| Large-capacity pools (>10 drives) | RAIDZ3 for extra safety |

---

## Summary
- **RAIDZ2** protects against two disk failures — ideal for reliability and capacity balance.  
- **RAIDZ3** protects against three disk failures — best for maximum data safety.  

Both are part of ZFS’s powerful, self-healing, and flexible storage system that ensures data integrity even in large-scale environments.
