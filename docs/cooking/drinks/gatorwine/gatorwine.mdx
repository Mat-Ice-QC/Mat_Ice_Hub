            # Recipe


            It seems weird but it is really good.


            ## Ingredients


            - **1 part Blue Gatorade** (Cool Blue or similar)
            - **1 part cheap red wine** (any dry or semi-sweet table wine)


            ## Instructions


            1. Pour **equal parts** of blue Gatorade and red wine into a glass.
            2. Stir gently until the colors blend into a deep purple.
            3. Serve **cold**, ideally over ice.


            ## Optional


            - Add a slice of **lime** or **lemon** for a touch of acidity.
            - Use a **wine glass**.

            # Why it works?

            This document explains, why mixing equal parts of blue Gatorade and inexpensive red wine often produces a surprisingly palatable beverage. The explanation covers flavor chemistry, mouthfeel, color interactions, and perceptual effects.

            ## Flavor chemistry and balance

            - **Sweetness and acidity balance**: Cheap red wines are often acidic and tannic. Blue Gatorade provides sugar and electrolytes that mask bitterness and soften tannins while maintaining a pleasant acidic backbone.
            - **Buffering and salt effects**: Sodium and potassium in the sports drink enhance perceived sweetness and suppress sourness slightly, resulting in a rounder flavor.

            ## Color and aromatic interaction

            - **Anthocyanins (wine)** are pH-sensitive pigments that provide red/purple color.
            - **Brilliant Blue FCF (Gatorade)** is stable in acidic solutions and, when optically combined with red anthocyanins, produces a deep purple hue that cues the brain to expect fruity flavors.

            ## Ethanol and electrolyte interplay

            - **Mouthfeel**: Ethanol alone can feel drying. Electrolytes and additional fluid from Gatorade reduce that perception, giving a smoother mouthfeel.
            - **Metabolic effect**: Simple sugars increase the perceived energy and can make alcohol feel less harsh, although they may increase absorption rate slightly.

            ## Sensory perception

            - The temperature, color, and sweetened profile shift perception from "wine" toward "wine cooler" or fruity cocktail, reducing perceived harshness.

            ## Quick summary table

            | Property | Red Wine | Blue Gatorade | Combined Effect |
            |---|---:|---:|---|
            | pH | ~3.2–3.6 | ~3.0–3.5 | Balanced acidity |
            | Sugar | Low | High | Moderated sweetness |
            | Alcohol | 12–14% | 0% | ~6–7% (diluted) |
            | Electrolytes | None | Na⁺, K⁺ | Less drying mouthfeel |
            | Color | Red | Blue | Purple (fruit cue) |

            ## Technical appendix

            - **pH and anthocyanins**: Anthocyanin structural forms shift with pH, altering visible color. In acidic ranges typical of wine and sports drinks (pH ~3), anthocyanins remain in colored flavylium forms; mixing with a blue dye results in additive optical mixing rather than chemical destruction.
            - **Ethanol and osmolality**: The added sugars and salts increase solution osmolality, which affects oral lubrication and perception of viscosity.
