# Mat Ice Hub

**Mat Ice Hub** is my personal website — a collection of scripts, hardware documentation, and random things I build or experiment with.  
You can visit it here: [https://matice.ca](https://matice.ca)

## About

This site serves as a central hub for:
- **Scripts & Code Snippets** — custom utilities, automation scripts, and experiments  
- **Hardware Projects** — documentation, notes, and schematics for DIY builds  
- **Random Stuff** — thoughts, guides, and whatever else I feel like posting  

Basically, it’s my personal digital lab and archive.
